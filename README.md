# tournament
Java Backend Engineer Test Task
### Summary

A web service (HTTP REST API) to work with tournaments.

### Glossary

A *Tournament* is an object consists of max number of participants multiples of 8 (8, 16, 32, etc...) and number of [single-elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament) matches that will be played.

A *Match* is an object consist of two participants, start time, finish time and participant scores.

A *Participant* is an object consist of unique id and unique nickname or even just unique id. The mechanism for creating and storing members is not important. Any options are acceptable from filling in the *java.util.Map* by hand or saving to the database via endpoints.

### Details

Operations to be provided by the web service:

- Creating a tournament.
- Getting a tournament by its identifier.
- Starting a tournament. Each tournament must have that endpoint, which must generate match grid and appoint opponents for participants (in random way). (including when there are an odd number of participants, e.g. 7/8 or 15/16 participants).
- Adding participants in tournament.
- Removing participants from tournament while it's on hold.
- Summarizing results in match.

### Requirements

- The API must conform to the REST architecture.
- Do only the server side, you don't need to do visualization.
- It should be a Spring Boot application.
- Maven or Gradle should be used as a build tool.
- Data should only be stored in RDBMS.
- Al least 30% of the code should be covered by tests.
- Submit sources via a public git repository.
- You shouldâ€™t use @RepositoryRestController.

Preparation
1. Create a MySQL Database and set user and password in pom.xml ( for FlyWay) and in application.proprties
2. Migrate tables into Database using Maven Flyway plugin (for instance)

_____________________________________________________________________
Let's test the application. Here is the chronologic that can be sticked to:
1. Create a tournament
2. Create participants
3. Assign participants to a tournament
4. Start tournament. Matches are generated and 2 participants are added to a single match. If an odd quantity of participants is added, then the last participant remains without match. This last team will be added to the next qualification match. I have created a controller that let adding a match to the tournament, but the quantity of adding match should not exceed matchQuantity (that is generated basing on maxParticipants quantity).
Also I used Set for a list of participants in Tournament class to be sure that one participant is added only one time.
5. Get tournament information
6. Get match information
7. Add further match

1.Create a tournament
POST
http://localhost:8080/tournament

{
    "name": "Test tournament",
    "maxParticipants": 8
}

2. Create participants (one participant can be created at a time)
Create Participant
POST
http://localhost:8080/participants
{
    "name": "Participant1"
}
_____

{
    "name": "Participant2"
}

_____

{
    "name": "Participant3"
}

_____

{
    "name": "Participant4"
}

_____

{
    "name": "Participant5"
}
_____

{
    "name": "Participant6"
}

_____

{
    "name": "Participant7"
}



3. Assign participants to a tournament(id of tournament and participants are required for that! )
Let's assume that tournament id - 2, participants' id - [2..8]
Add participants to a tournament
PUT
http://localhost:8080/tournament/2/add-participants/
[
    {"id": 2},
	{"id": 3},
	{"id": 4},
	{"id": 5},
	{"id": 6},
	{"id": 7},
	{"id": 8}
]

4. Start tournament. Let's assume that tournament id - 2
POST
http://localhost:8080/tournament/2/start

5. Get tournament information. Let's assume that tournament id - 2
GET 
http://localhost:8080/tournament/2

6. Get match results. Let's assume that match id - 2
GET
http://localhost:8080/match/2

7. Add match
POST
http://localhost:8080/tournament/2/create-match
{
    "startTime": null,
    "finishTime": null,
    "participant1Score": 123,
    "participant2Score": 123,
    "participantsId": [5, 4]
}
